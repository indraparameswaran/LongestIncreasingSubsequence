# LongestIncreasingSubsequence

Requirement -Finding the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers less than 100.
Created a LIS class to generate list of random numbers 
Created a method to determine the longest increasing subsequence for the randomly generated list using binary search method
Verified the code with a randomly greated list to check if the result was correct, anle to confirm with different list.
Code uploaded to git hun intially after generating random list and then finally after LIS was completed.
